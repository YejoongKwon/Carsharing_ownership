# Impact of Car-Sharing Services on Vehicle Registrations and Mileage

## 1.Introduction and Background:

* Transformation of the mobility industry driven by sharing concept
* Introduction of garage-based car sharing services in Korea
* Potential decrease in privately-owned cars and environmental benefits

## 2.Research Objective:

* Investigating the impact of car-sharing services on vehicle registrations and mileage
* Assessing changes using Difference-in-Difference (DiD) method and Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)
* Utilizing panel data from 2010 to 2020

## 3.Variables:

* Dependent variables: Number of registered passenger cars, mileage of passenger cars
* Independent variable: Car-sharing entry in 227 cities and counties nationwide

## 4.Methodology:
* Difference-in-Difference (DiD) method
* Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)
* Analysis considering the availability of car-sharing garages in different areas

## 5.Findings:
* Statistically significant decrease in private car registrations in urban areas after car-sharing service initiation
* No significant effect on registrations in areas with limited access to car-sharing garages

## 6.Benefits of Car-Sharing:
* Benefits extend to both car-sharing users and non-users, particularly in urban areas
* Decrease in privately-owned cars potential as car-sharing services expand and become more accessible through garages

## 7.Implications:
* Evidence of the positive impact of car-sharing services in urban settings
* Potential for environmental benefits through reduced emissions

## 8.Conclusion:
* Empirical study highlights the benefits of car-sharing services in urban areas
* Identifies the potential for decreasing privately-owned cars with expanded and accessible car-sharing services through garages.
